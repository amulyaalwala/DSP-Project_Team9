**Sign langugage dataset URL: https://www.kaggle.com/prayagaaneesh1/hand-language

**Phase 1_Hand Gesture Dataset URL: https://www.kaggle.com/prayagaaneesh1/my-dataset

**Grayscale hand gesture dataset URL: https://www.kaggle.com/benenharrington/hand-gesture-recognition-database-with-cnn/data


**Important Note:**
•	Dataset paths need to be modified in all the files.
•	Since we have Mac M1 chip, which is not compatible with TensorFlow, we worked on Colab and Kaggle, hence some code can be tweaked to make it work in these environments.
•	The Sign language data set sometimes reads 27 classes instead of 26 classes due to a ipynb file that is sometimes getting added, this can be deleted to make the code work ( I have split the dataset into train and test in Google Colab, which might be causing this issue)
•	Phas1_CNN_Grayscale.ipynb uses **gray scale hand gesture dataset**
•	Phase1_VGG.ipynb uses **Phase1_Hand Gesture Dataset**
•	**Phase2_InceptionV3 .ipynb** and **Phase2_VGG.ipynb** files use the **Sign language dataset**
•	**The Sign Language Dataset** and **Phase1_Hand Gesture Dataset** folder have train, test folders with in them.


This project is implemented for Data Science Programming course and has references and inspiration from a lot of information available from research papers, keras and other kaggle implementations
